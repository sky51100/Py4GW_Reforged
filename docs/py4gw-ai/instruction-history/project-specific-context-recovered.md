# Recovered Py4GW Project-Specific Context

This is the archival recovery of project facts removed from earlier root
instruction files. The concise active context map is
`py4gw-project-context.md`; keep this file for provenance and complete
historical detail. Neither file replaces the active behavioral rules.

## Recovery provenance

- The previous tracked root `AGENTS.md` was recovered from `HEAD` and preserved below.
- The previous root `CLAUDE.md` was ignored and untracked; its unique project facts are reconstructed in the next section from the prior local contents available during this session.

## Recovered unique CLAUDE.md context

The previous root `CLAUDE.md` was ignored and untracked, so it is not recoverable from Git. The following project-specific facts are reconstructed from the prior local file contents available during this session:

### Legacy parity sources

- The legacy Python tree is at `C:\\Users\\Apo\\Py4GW_python_files`; it mirrors this repository and is read-only. For migration parity or dropped behavior, compare the current Python file against its legacy twin there first.
- The legacy GWCA-era project is at `C:\\Users\\Apo\\Py4GW`; its `vendor/gwca` tree is a cross-reference, not the current source of truth.
- Do not infer migration behavior from the current file alone when a legacy twin exists.

### Canonical architecture and runtime

- `Py4GW.dll` is a Windows-only 32-bit injected DLL embedding CPython through pybind11 and rendering a Dear ImGui overlay.
- The Python library has a bindings path (embedded `Py*` modules with `stubs/*.pyi`) and a context path (ctypes structures read from shared memory under `Py4GWCoreLib/native_src/context/`).
- The layer stack is: Guild Wars process/native bindings; `Py4GWCoreLib/` as the Python source-of-truth layer; `py4gwcorelib_src/` support infrastructure; `GLOBAL_CACHE` cached consumers/shared memory; and combat automation schedulers.
- Active operations route through the action queue rather than direct writes where the owning API provides that path.

### ImGui ownership

- The abandoned `ImGuiRuntime` facade, `ImGui_src/_runtime.py`, `ImGui_Legacy`, and related duplicate facade names are not active implementations.
- The active wrapper is the original `ImGui` class in `Py4GWCoreLib/ImGui_src/ImGuisrc.py`, re-exported by `Py4GWCoreLib/ImGui.py`, with existing call sites using `from Py4GWCoreLib import ImGui`.

### Companion references

- Use `docs/architecture/reference/py4-gw-conceptual-model.md` for architecture and terminology.
- Use `docs/bridge/mcp/mcp-bridge.md` and `BridgeRuntime/README.md` for bridge/MCP planning and operator/runtime usage.
- Read relevant handovers such as `FOLLOW_REFACTOR_HANDOVER.md`, `DBMGR_HANDOVER.md`, `docs/ui/widget-manager/widget-manager-and-catalog.md`, `docs/automation/behavior-trees/bottingtree-and-bt-routines-guide.md`, `heroai-combat-handover.md`, and `settings_database_cache_model.md` before changing those subsystems.
- Use `docs/architecture/records/reforged-migration/` for the ongoing legacy-GWCA to Reforged-Native migration record.

### Runtime/tooling constraints

- Injected/runtime work requires Python 3.13.0 32-bit; changing interpreter versions can crash the Guild Wars client.
- There is no CI, pytest/tox configuration, Makefile, or global test runner. Use targeted scripts.
- `pyproject.toml` configures Black with line length 120 and no string-normalization, plus isort one-import-per-line. `pyrightconfig.json` uses `stubPath = ./stubs`.
- Pylance/Pyright is required for changed Python; `py_compile` alone is insufficient.

### Entry points and focused checks

- `Py4GW_Launcher.py` is the external launcher/injector UI.
- `Py4GW_widget_manager.py` bootstraps in-client widgets.
- The bridge path is `Widgets/Coding/Tools/Bridge Client.py` -> `bridge_daemon.py` -> `bridge_cli.py`; `py4gw_mcp_server.py` is the MCP adapter.
- `Sources/modular_bot/` is authoritative for ModularBot; widget copies are wrappers.
- Focused checks include `python "bridge_daemon.py" --help`, `python "bridge_cli.py" --help`, `python "py4gw_mcp_server.py" --help`, `python "Sources/modular_bot/tools/validate_modular_docs.py"`, `python "Widgets/Data/test_merchant_rules_regression.py"`, and applicable standalone root `test_*.py` scripts.

### Widget and shared-state gotchas

- Widget discovery is folder-based: a folder under `Widgets/` is a discovery root only when it has a `.widget` marker; every Python file in that folder loads as a widget.
- Widget metadata defaults come from `Py4GWCoreLib/py4gwcorelib_src/WidgetManager.py`.
- `HeroAI/follow/__init__.py` intentionally exports nothing; import exact submodules such as `HeroAI.follow.leader_publish`.
- `Py4GWCoreLib/GlobalCache/SharedMemory.py` is startup-sensitive and imports that exact submodule; do not broaden package-root imports.
- The MCP adapter intentionally exposes a narrow safe tool set rather than arbitrary bridge calls.

## Recovered previous AGENTS.md

# AGENTS.md

- No repo-level CI/test runner is configured: no `.github/workflows`, no `pytest`/`tox` config, no `Makefile`, and `requirements.txt` is empty. Verify with targeted scripts instead of guessing a global command.
- `pyproject.toml` only configures formatting. Preserve Black at `line-length = 120`, keep single quotes if already present (`skip-string-normalization = true`), and keep `isort`'s one-import-per-line style (`force_single_line = true`).
- `pyrightconfig.json` only sets `stubPath = ./stubs` and suppresses missing module source noise. Use `pyright` only if it is installed in the environment.
- README explicitly targets Python 3.13.0 32-bit for injected/runtime work. Do not casually switch interpreter versions when debugging launcher or injection issues.
- `Py4GWCoreLib/__init__.py` is a broad convenience facade, not a minimal import surface: it manually appends system `site-packages`, re-exports most high-level modules, and redirects `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr` into the Py4GW console. Avoid treating `import Py4GWCoreLib` as a neutral import when debugging startup/import side effects.

## Persistence — HARD RULE (no exceptions)

**Every file that touches disk in this project must go through one of the two sanctioned classes. There are NO bypasses, ever.**

- **All INI / flat config → `Settings`** (`Py4GWCoreLib/py4gwcorelib_src/Settings.py`, wraps native `PySettings`).
- **All JSON / structured data → `JsonFactory`** (`Py4GWCoreLib/py4gwcorelib_src/JsonFactory.py`, wraps native `PyJson`).

Both are self-throttled, self-persisting singletons keyed by `(name, scope)`; scope is `"account"` or `"global"` (both jailed under `settings/` / `json/`). **There is no `"root"` scope** — it now raises. The single project-root file, `Py4GW.ini`, is reached ONLY via the hardcoded, path-less accessor `Settings.py4gw_ini()`.

**Forbidden anywhere in project code** (not just "discouraged"): `open()` for config/data, `json.load`/`json.dump`, `configparser`, `pickle`, `codecs.open`, `pathlib` `read_text`/`write_text` for persistence, `shutil` copies of config, and hand-rolled atomic-write / lock-file / directory-enumeration machinery (the native side already does atomic writes, cross-process locking on `global` scope, and autosave). No IPC or cross-account comms through files — use the messaging layer (`GLOBAL_CACHE.ShMem`). Never read another account's file directly; put shared data in `global` scope.

**If `Settings` / `JsonFactory` (or their native backends) do NOT provide functionality you need, STOP and notify the user to add it** — propose the missing method/primitive on the class or in `Py4GW_Reforged_Native`. Do NOT work around a gap with a raw handler. (Known open gap: reading bundled read-only catalogs shipped in the source tree needs a Native "read bundled file" primitive or a `json/Defaults/` seed template.)

The only sanctioned non-class disk access: `Py4GWCoreLib/database_src/DBMgr.py` (sqlite, reworked later), and separate non-injected processes that physically cannot load the embedded modules (the external launcher, the bridge/MCP stack). Full audit + rationale in `docs/persistence/audit/`.

## Backend: legacy GWCA → Reforged Native (active migration)

- The `Py4GW.dll` this Python library loads is built by a **separate sibling C++ project, `Py4GW_Reforged_Native`** (`../Py4GW_Reforged_Native`) — a 32-bit injected DLL that embeds CPython (pybind11), hooks D3D9, and renders ImGui. It is a ground-up rework **replacing the legacy GWCA backend**, itself under parity migration (GWCA managers → `GW/<module>/`). Build there is CMake (`cmake -S . -B build -A Win32` / `vs2022-win32` presets) — no build command from this Python repo applies to it.
- This Python library reaches the game via **two data paths**: the **bindings path** (`Py*` embedded modules, type-stubbed in `stubs/*.pyi`) and the **context path** (ctypes structs from shared memory, read by `Py4GWCoreLib/native_src/context/*.py`).
- The library is being repointed from the legacy GWCA-era binding surface to the Reforged Native surface; session log in `docs/architecture/records/reforged-migration/`. Assume Reforged names in new code: `Py2DRenderer`→`PyDXOverlay`, `PyCombatEvents`→`PyAgentEvents`, `PyPointers` retired, `Py4GW.Console.*`→`PySystem.Console.*`, `Py4GW.Game.*`→`PySystem`/`PyGameThread`, `Point2D/3D`→`Vec2f/Vec3f`, `PyScanCodeKeystroke`→`PyKeyHandler`. Reforged `Py*` classes favor getter methods + module-level functions over legacy data fields.
- `Py4GWCoreLib.ImGui` is the single ImGui wrapper — the class previously called `ImGui_Legacy`, restored to its original name. The from-scratch `ImGuiRuntime` facade rebuild was abandoned and deleted (its specs under `docs/ui/imgui/im-gui-facade-migration-plan.md` are dead).

## Docs Hierarchy

- `docs/architecture/reference/py4-gw-conceptual-model.md` is the canonical architecture/source-of-truth document for project layers and terminology.
- `docs/bridge/mcp/mcp-bridge.md` is the MCP-facing bridge planning summary; use it for bridge/MCP modeling, not as the primary architecture source.
- `BridgeRuntime/README.md` is the operator/runtime usage reference for daemon + injected bridge client + CLI.
- `docs/architecture/reference/py4-gw-model-features-detail.txt` is a derived plain-text export for quick scanning, not a separate authority.
- `docs/ui/widget-manager/widget-manager-and-catalog.md` is the highest-value reference before changing widget discovery, widget metadata defaults, `WidgetHandler`, or `WidgetCatalog` behavior.

## RE (Reverse Engineering) — `docs/game-client/research/`

- **WASM-first workflow (do this by default).** Reverse-engineer on `/Gw.wasm` first, then map the confirmed result to `/Gw.exe`. The WASM retains full debug symbols (`CCharAgent::GetConsiderColor`, `FrameCreate`, `CtlTextMl::Markup`, …), so behaviour, control flow, struct fields, and call chains are far faster and less error-prone to read there. The EXE is stripped (`FUN_xxxxxxxx`) — only enter it at the **end**, to resolve the concrete address the injector needs. Reading architecture in the EXE first is slow and mistake-prone. Watch for genuine ABI differences (WASM `call_indirect` table indices vs. x86 real pointers; possible `Color4b`/struct channel-order repacks) — the architecture transfers, but re-confirm low-level calling/ABI details on the EXE. When calling Ghidra MCP tools, always pass the explicit `program` path (the project has multiple same-named `Gw.exe` images; a name-omitted call silently hits the wrong one). See `docs/game-client/research/cpp-wasm-mapping.md` for the translation procedure.
- **Authoritative C++ backend is now `Py4GW_Reforged_Native`, not GWCA.** The migrated managers live at `../Py4GW_Reforged_Native/src/GW/<module>/` + `include\GW\<module>\` (each module declares named ownership of every resolved symbol; `<module>_patterns.cpp` holds the `Resolve*` functions), and runtime addresses come from `Py4GW_Reforged_Native\offsets\<module>.json` (byte patterns/masks + step resolvers), **not** hardcoded. See that repo's `docs/06-pattern-json-system.md`, `docs/module-migration-guide.md`, and `docs/gwca-manager-dependency-map.md`. The legacy GWCA tree at `../Py4GW/vendor/gwca` still exists and is a useful cross-reference for how a subsystem worked pre-Reforged, but it is no longer the source of truth. The `Gw.exe`/`Gw.wasm` address tables below describe the actual game and remain valid regardless of wrapper.
- **Start with `docs/game-client/research/reverse-engineering-reference.md`** — the comprehensive library reference. Covers the three-layer architecture (Python `native_src`, C++ GWCA, Ghidra), key function catalogs with EXE↔WASM↔CPP mappings, bridging techniques, UI message dispatch architecture, and workflows for adding new functions.
- `docs/game-client/research/cpp-wasm-mapping.md` — the full CPP↔WASM↔EXE translation procedure with worked examples and pitfall notes.
- `docs/game-client/research/rosetta-stone.txt` — GwA2 (AutoIt) to Py4GW function mapping reference.
- `docs/game-client/research/gw-combat-ai-reverse-engineering.md` — combat AI RE analysis.
- `docs/ui/research/native-gw-window-creation-investigation.md` — window proc creation RE.
- `docs/ui/research/native-ui-title-and-encoded-string-reference.md` — UI title and encoding reference.
- `docs/ui/name-tag-colors/feature-guide.md` — historical feature/usage guide for `PyAgentTagColor`; current source uses the expanded `PyAgentRecolor` surface.
- `docs/ui/name-tag-colors/reverse-engineering.md` — preserved RE record for the agent/item name-tag pipeline and historical detour; verify current native/module names before relying on it. In-client test harness: `tests/name_tag_color/name_tag_color_test.py`.

### UI Message System

The game uses a **hash table** (`THashTable<IFrame::Msg::CHandler>` at `DAT_ram_005a0338`) for message dispatch, not a switch statement. Messages fall into three ranges:
- `0x00–0x55` — base frame lifecycle
- `0x100000xx` — server→client notifications (~90 mapped, ~15 unknown, ~6 newly discovered via WASM)
- `0x300000xx` — client→server commands (~30 mapped, all send-to-server actions)

The authoritative UIMessage enum is now the migrated `enum class UIMessage : uint32_t` in `../Py4GW_Reforged_Native/include/GW/common/constants/ui.h` (aliased as `GW::ui::UIMessage` in `include\GW\ui\ui.h`). The legacy GWCA enum at `../Py4GW/vendor/gwca/Include/GWCA/Managers/UIMgr.h` remains a cross-reference. To discover missing messages, either hook the send path at runtime (Reforged Native registers UI-message callbacks; legacy GWCA hooked `SendUIMessage_Func`) or run a Ghidra script against WASM callers of `FrameMsgSendRegistered`. Full procedure including the script is in `docs/game-client/research/reverse-engineering-reference.md` Section 4.

## Entry Points

- `Py4GW_widget_manager.py` is the in-client widget bootstrap: it creates the manager INI key, runs widget discovery, and hands off to `Widgets/WidgetCatalog/Py4GW_widget_catalog.py`.
- `Py4GW_Launcher.py` is the external launcher/injector UI.
- Bridge stack wiring is split across:
  - injected widget: `Widgets/Coding/Tools/Bridge Client.py`
  - daemon: `bridge_daemon.py`
  - operator CLI: `bridge_cli.py`
- MCP adapter entrypoint is `py4gw_mcp_server.py`; it talks to the daemon over stdio->daemon bridging rather than directly to injected clients.
- Bridge defaults are verified in code: widget server `127.0.0.1:47811`, control server `127.0.0.1:47812`, and the CLI targets control port `47812` by default.
- `Sources/modular_bot/` contains the real ModularBot implementation. Files under `Widgets/Automation/modularbot/` are mostly thin wrappers that expose those tools/prebuilts through Widget Manager.

## Focused Checks

- Bridge help / argument discovery:
  - `python "bridge_daemon.py" --help`
  - `python "bridge_cli.py" --help`
- MCP adapter help / surface discovery:
  - `python "py4gw_mcp_server.py" --help`
- ModularBot docs coverage check:
  - `python "Sources/modular_bot/tools/validate_modular_docs.py"`

## Repo-Specific Gotchas

- For architecture questions, prefer module-specific imports and docs over the broad `Py4GWCoreLib` facade. The conceptual model treats `Py4GWCoreLib` as the single Python-facing source-of-truth layer, `py4gwcorelib_src` as support infrastructure, and `GLOBAL_CACHE` as a derivative consumer/cache layer.
- The current MCP adapter intentionally exposes a narrow safe tool set over daemon control, not generic arbitrary bridge calls: `list_clients`, `list_namespaces`, `list_commands`, `describe_runtime`, `get_map_state`, `get_player_state`, and `list_agents`.
- Widget discovery is folder-based, not file-based: `WidgetHandler` walks `Widgets/`, and only folders containing a `.widget` marker are discovery roots; every `.py` file in that same folder is loaded as a widget.
- Widget metadata defaults are non-obvious and come from `Py4GWCoreLib/py4gwcorelib_src/WidgetManager.py`: `MODULE_CATEGORY` defaults to the first `widget_path` segment, `MODULE_TAGS` defaults to all path segments, and `OPTIONAL` defaults to `False` only for `System` and `Py4GW` categories.
- Before touching follow-system code, read `FOLLOW_REFACTOR_HANDOVER.md`.
- `Py4GWCoreLib/GlobalCache/SharedMemory.py` is startup-sensitive and currently imports `HeroAI.follow.leader_publish` directly. Do not replace that with broad package-root imports.
- `HeroAI/follow/__init__.py` intentionally exports nothing. Import exact submodules such as `HeroAI.follow.leader_publish`, not `HeroAI.follow`.
- Avoid committing local runtime/config churn unless the task is specifically about them: `Py4GW.ini`, `Py4GW_Launcher.ini`, and `py4-gw-injection-log.txt`. README documents `git update-index --skip-worktree` for those files.
