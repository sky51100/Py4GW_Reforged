"""The Loot Filters configuration -- one class, instantiated twice.

**A script NEVER persists.** Whatever a script does lives in memory and never reaches disk. That is
the invariant everything here rests on, and the doubling is how it is enforced structurally rather
than by discipline: the feature holds a **persisted** instance and a **live** instance of this same
class. The user writes persisted; a script writes live; they are different objects, so a live change
physically cannot reach the user's configuration.

Everything else follows mechanically:

* live starts as a copy of persisted;
* reset is replacing live with a fresh copy;
* "is a script changing things?" is comparing the two;
* "what is it changing?" is diffing them;
* a restart is a reset, because live never existed on disk.

**Id-keyed entries are session-only.** Agent and item ids are per-instance: they mean nothing after a
map change, and reusing one would want or suppress an unrelated drop. They are never persisted and are
cleared on map change. Model ids are stable and persist normally.
