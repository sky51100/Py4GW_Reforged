"""Filter rules and profiles -- pure data.

**Terminology.** A **filter** is the *composite resolver*: criteria composed together, yielding one
verdict per item. A single condition inside it is a **criterion**, never "a filter". A **profile** is
a named set of filters.

**A filter is criteria, plus the marking outcome it carries.** The criteria say *what matches*. For
Loot Filters that is the whole story -- the outcome is *wanted*, and there is nothing to configure. For
Recolor & Beacons the outcome is a **recolour and/or a beacon**, which has values, and those values sit
**on the filter**: *"each filter **is** a recolour or a beacon"*.

There is deliberately **no separate object binding an outcome onto a filter afterwards**. That binding
step was the reverted build's invention and is what produced the "two competing orderings" defect. One
filter, carrying its own outcome, has one order -- the profile's.

The ``mark_*`` fields are read and written **only** by Recolor & Beacons; Loot Filters ignores them
entirely. So one filter serves both features without either inheriting the other's behaviour.

**Nothing here decides.** No callables, no predicates: a filter is values, and the matcher owns all
evaluation. That is what stops a script handing the class its own ruling to run.

**Shape follows the Item Mods Playground** (`Widgets/Coding/Debug/Py4GW/Item Mods Playground.py`),
which is the existing, working example of filtering items by mods: upgrades are chosen by **slot and
name** (never modifier ids), the requirement is *at most*, and there is **one ALL/ANY mode for the
whole rule** rather than separate all-of and any-of lists.

**Numbers are match-or-better, never exact** -- item mods are defined that way, so filters follow the
data.
