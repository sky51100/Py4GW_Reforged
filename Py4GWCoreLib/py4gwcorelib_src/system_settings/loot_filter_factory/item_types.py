"""Item types a filter can match on, grouped.

**Every type that can drop is filterable. Anything that cannot drop gets no filter at all.**

**Umbrella members are never filterable entries.** `Weapon`, `MartialWeapon`, `SpellcastingWeapon`,
`OffhandOrShield`, `EquippableItem` and `Unknown` are *definitions* (`ITEM_TYPE_META_TYPES`), not
things a user picks -- offering them beside the concrete types would let one filter be written two
ways (`MartialWeapon` versus Axe+Sword+...), and **no group may duplicate another group's flags**.

**Weapons is one flat group of 11.** The enum contradicts itself here -- `ItemType.Weapon` is 9 while
`WEAPON_TYPES` is 11 -- and we take the broader reading, including Offhand and Shield. The
contradiction itself is *not* fixed as part of this work; see
`docs/architecture/records/pending-fixes.md` PF-1.

The martial / spellcasting / offhand subdivision the enum describes is deliberately **not** surfaced:
the user sees the weapon list, not its internal taxonomy.
